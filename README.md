# Coastie

## Requirements
Coastie expects that you can create a new namespace, and deploy containers and services to it.

Coastie expects you are already logged into the cluster you want to test.


## Alpha
This base is currently in alpha status, and will likely move from bash to a dedicated app at a later point.
